This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to data frame creation with inconsistent column types. The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts to create a data frame with a mix of numeric and character values in one column and logical values in another. While R might not always throw an explicit error, the resulting data frame may not reflect the user's intention. The solution in `bugSolution.R` showcases the use of explicit type coercion to avoid unexpected behavior.
